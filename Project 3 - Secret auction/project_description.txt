Secret auction
------------------------------------------------

This Python script implements a secret auction program. 
It begins by importing necessary modules and a graphic logo. The script defines two functions:

# ask_for_bids(individual_competitor): This function prompts the user to input their name and bid. It then stores this information in a dictionary called individual_competitor and returns it.

# evaluate_highest_bid(auction_competitors): This function iterates through the dictionary auction_competitors to find the highest bid and the corresponding winner. It then prints the winner's name and bid.

The main() function initializes the auction by displaying the logo and a welcome message. 
It sets up an empty dictionary auction_competitors to store competitors and iteratively collects bids until there are no more bidders. 
After collecting all bids, it calls evaluate_highest_bid() to determine the winner and prints the result.

The script executes the main() function if the script is run directly.
