Typical word guessing game called HANGMAN:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is a simple Python game where the player has to guess letters in a word. Here's a breakdown:

1) It imports necessary modules: random, os, and specific components from custom modules graphic and words.
2) Prints a logo using ASCII art stored in the graphic module.
3) Selects a random word from a predefined list.
4) Sets up a display list to track the guessed letters of the word (initially all letters are represented by underscores).
5) Enters a loop where the player guesses letters until they either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
6) Inside the loop:
        Prompts the player for a letter guess.
        Checks if the guess is correct:
            If correct, updates the display accordingly.
            If incorrect, decrements the number of lives and prints a hangman stage.
        Checks for game ending conditions:
            If the word is completely guessed, the player wins.
            If the player runs out of lives, the player loses, revealing the correct word.
        Also, checks for duplicate guesses and informs the player if they've already tried that letter.
7) Clears the console screen after each guess for a cleaner display.
